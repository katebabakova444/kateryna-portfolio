## About

This portfolio documents my transition from anesthesiology to backend software engineering.Â Â 

Since February 2025, Iâ€™ve been building projects to develop core backend skills â€” moving from simple CLI tools to more structured, modular, testable applications.

## Why this portfolio?

I believe in learning by building â€” through small, real projects that grow in complexity.Â Â 
This portfolio shows how Iâ€™ve worked step by step to develop my backend engineering skills â€” from simple CLI tools to more advanced, testable systems.Â Â 

My background in anesthesiology gives me a focus on reliability, clarity, and responsibility â€” qualities I bring to my work as a backend engineer.
