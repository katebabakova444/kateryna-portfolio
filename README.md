## About

This portfolio reflects my progression from building simple CLI tools  
to designing **structured, testable backend-oriented systems**.

I started learning Python in early 2025.  
Since then, I’ve intentionally moved from basic scripts toward applications with:

- modular architecture  
- persistent storage  
- validation and error handling  
- automated testing  
- real-world domain logic  

My background in anesthesiology strongly influences how I build software:  
I value **clarity, reliability, and responsibility for system behavior**.

## Featured Projects (Current Level)

### Anesthesia Log Simulator  
**Python · OOP · SQLite · Testing · Flask · Deployment**

Real-world inspired backend-oriented system for anesthesia dosage calculations and logging.

This project represents a clear shift from isolated CLI scripts  
to a **structured backend system**.

**Key highlights:**
- Modular OOP architecture (clear separation of responsibilities)
- Drug dosage calculations based on patient data
- Persistent data storage (SQLite)
- Input validation and error handling
- Automated unit tests
- Deployed service with health check

**GitHub:**

### Casino Odds Analyzer  
**Python · OOP · Game State · Probability Logic**

Dice-based simulation focused on randomness, statistics, and state tracking.

This project helped bridge my transition from basic CLI apps  
to more **stateful and logic-driven systems**.

**Focus areas:**
- game state management
- separation of logic from user interaction
- probability and statistical reasoning
- object-oriented design

### Telegram Message Scheduler  
**Python · Automation · Scheduling · External APIs**

Backend automation tool for scheduling and delivering delayed messages via Telegram.

This project demonstrates working with **external APIs**,  
time-based logic, and background-style task execution.

**Key highlights:**
- Message scheduling logic
- Integration with Telegram Bot API
- Backgound scheduling ('APScheduler')
- Time-based logic testing using `pytest` + `monkeypatch`
- Practical automation use case

## Earlier Projects (Foundations)

These projects represent my **early learning stage** and helped build strong fundamentals in Python and OOP.

They are intentionally kept as part of this portfolio to show **learning progression**, not just final results.

## Current Technical Focus

- REST API design (Flask)
- Data persistence and validation
- Writing testable backend code
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns
- CI/CD basics with GitHub Actions
- Deployment (Render)

## Why This Portfolio

I believe in learning by building —  
through small, real projects that gradually increase in complexity.

This portfolio intentionally shows **progression**:
from simple CLI tools to backend-oriented systems with responsibility for data, state and correctness.
